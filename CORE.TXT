1. Data Collection:
User Input: Allow users to input data about wasted food items. Include details such as type of food, quantity, and reason for waste.
Timestamp: Capture the date and time when the data is entered to track when the wastage occurred.

2. Data Storage:
Database: Store the collected data in a database. You can use databases like MySQL, MongoDB, or Firebase Realtime Database, depending on your tech stack.
Schema: Design a database schema to store information about wasted food items, including type, quantity, timestamp, and user ID (if your application has user authentication).

3. Backend/API:
API Endpoints: Create API endpoints to handle data retrieval and calculations. For example, you might have endpoints to fetch wasted food data for analytics and to calculate environmental impact.
Calculation Logic: Implement logic to calculate the environmental impact based on the quantity and type of wasted food. Research environmental impact factors related to food waste for accurate calculations.

4. Frontend:
Dashboard: Design a user-friendly dashboard to display analytics. Include charts and graphs to visualize trends in food wastage over time.
Environmental Impact Section: Create a dedicated section to display environmental impact calculations. Present data on reduced carbon footprint, water usage, and other relevant metrics.
Forms: Design forms for users to input details about wasted food items. Include dropdowns for food types, input fields for quantity, and selection options for reasons (e.g., expired, leftovers).

5. Visualization:
Charts and Graphs: Use charting libraries like Chart.js or D3.js to create visually appealing charts displaying trends in food wastage.
Environmental Impact Visualization: Create graphical representations to show the reduction in environmental impact over time. For example, use bar charts to display reduced carbon emissions.

6. User Education:
Tips and Suggestions: Provide users with tips on reducing food waste. Display these tips within the app, encouraging users to adopt eco-friendly practices.
Educational Content: Include educational content about the environmental impact of food waste. Use infographics and short articles to raise awareness.

7. Notifications and Alerts:
Reminders: Implement reminders for users to input their daily or weekly food waste data. Regular data input ensures accurate analytics.
Achievement Alerts: Send notifications when users achieve milestones, such as reducing a certain percentage of food waste.
